A project by the people, for the people

For a long time, seeing how people are increasingly used to relying on frameworks even for small projects, I wanted to build NewPlace using plain JavaScript to highlight the importance of pure software itself. With this, I'm not underestimating any framework or anyone’s work.
This project has been incredibly valuable for me to learn about integrating with Firebase databases, integration with Google API's, creating interactive tutorials, and much more.
